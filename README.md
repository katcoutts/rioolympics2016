# rioolympics2016
For my first project at CodeClan I was tasked with creating a Rio Olympics medal tracker which would be able. The user needed
to be able to create and save to a database new Nations, Athletes and Events. Athletes and Nations needed to be able to keep 
track of their medal count and associated points count.
I have created a league table on the homepage which ranks countries based initially on points total and then on their gold medal count - silver medal count - bronze medal count.
