The project brief provided was:

Client Expectations:
Must have - MVP:
The client wants a web app which allows the results for the Rio Olympics to be searched and displayed.  The app should all a search of results by country and by athlete.  It should return the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won by a country and the points tally where gold is worth 5 points, silver is worth 3 points and bronze is worth 1 point.
Additional required functionality is the ability to add nations, to add athletes to nations and to add the medal won by the athlete.
Could Have  - Supplementary functionality 
In addition, it could be nice to:
update and delete the athlete, event and country entries.  
search and list the event medalists
output results in JSON

Screenshot of an example of a country page. A country's page displays the relevant flag and a list of the athletes competing for that country together with the events they are competing in. It contains a dynamic medals table which shows the medals that country has won and what events they were won in.
